There are Bayesian Networks available from [this website](https://www.ccd.pitt.edu/wiki/index.php/Data_Repository). 
We shall take a closer look at some of them.

[This Kaggle kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/surendrakarna/asia-bayesiannetworks) 
provides a starting point and python interface which is quite useful. 
We shall do very interesting experiments with them.
