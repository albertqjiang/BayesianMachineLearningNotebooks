# BayesianMachineLearningNotebooks
Implementation makes perfect

This is a repository closely correlated with the Oxford course [Advanced Topics in Machine Learning](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/teaching/courses/2019-2020/advml/). I find myself still slightly confused after reading the course materials so decided to do some hands-on practice on the topic of Bayesian machine learning. This repository includes topics concerning Bayesian inference, sampling, etc. and will likely incorporate more advanced topics in the future.

The current contents include:
1. Bayesian networks
